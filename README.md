# multimarkov

This is a generic tool for training and using multi-order Markov chains for procedural generation applications such as generating randomized but authentic-sounding names for characters and locations.

It is a new implementation of [my markovmodels project (in Java)](https://github.com/joeclark-phd/markovmodels) but now in Rust.

It is not complete or usable yet.
